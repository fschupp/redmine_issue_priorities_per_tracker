= Redmine issue priorities per tracker plugin

This is a plugin for Redmine which allows to define issue priorities per tracker. Forked from flant/redmine_issue_priorities_per_tracker

Since PrototypeJS was removed in Rails 3.2, this plugin now depends on the [redmine_prototype_js](https://github.com/fschupp/redmine_prototype_js) Plugin which provides this functionality.

Modified to work with Redmine 2.6, work in progress.
